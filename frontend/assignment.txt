BUILD A SIMPLE CONTACTS WEB APP
(WITH OTP SMS SENDING FUNCTIONALITY)
Overview
For this project, you will use a web app that can send an OTP (via SMS) to a list of contacts, one at a time.
Requirements
1. The main page should have two menu options.
2. First Menu Option
1. List of contacts

Inputs: JSON list of contacts (you can create your own fake contacts - you can make the fake data by using a static JSON)
Outputs: Name of the Contact (First + Last) should show up in each row of the list.
Upon selecting a contact in the list, the contact info page for that contact will be displayed (in a new page).
2. Contact info page - Contact Details with button.
Display contact data: name, phone number.
Button saying "Send Message" which on click opens next screen.
3. New Message Screen (Compose).
Components: Text Field, Send button.
· Text Field needs to have text along the following lines: "Hi. Your OTP is: 123456". 123456 needs to be a random six-digit number. Upon hitting send, the contents of the text field will be sent to the selected recipient as an SMS using online services. For this you can a free trial of any of the services like Twilio, Vonage etc. If you do use these, then add the number +919810153260 to the accounts that can receive an SMS.
3. Second Menu Option
1. List of messages sent
In descending order of date-time
⚫ Inputs: list of messages already sent (you can choose the best way to do this)
4. User experience
Outputs: Each list item will be the Name of the contact, the time of the SMS and the OTP sent in the SMS.
1. Responsiveness.
2. You should try to handle Errors from the server (like the SMS one you choose to use).
3. You should consider client side input validation.
4. You should focus on general front end design and make it as professional as possible. It should work, be easy to navigate and use and free of clutter.
